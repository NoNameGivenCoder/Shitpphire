# NoNameVerse

This is an attempt to create a semi-miiversey social media platform, written in Node.JS.

# Setting up

To start the app, you must first create a `config.json` file. Please refer to the `example-config.json` file as a base, and add in all of your neccessary information there. Keep in mind you must have a MySQL installed, or an external database created. Also, import the `other/DatabaseStructure.sql` file. This will make your database compatible with NoNameVerse's.
